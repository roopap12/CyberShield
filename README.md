# Overview
CyberShield is a multi-service project designed to address the growing need for robust cybersecurity solutions. The project is structured around several key components, each serving a specific purpose in the cybersecurity ecosystem.
# AI Model Service
The AI Model Service is the backbone of CyberShield's threat detection capabilities. It utilises advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze data and identify potential cyber threats. This service is built with Python, leveraging libraries such as numpy and scikit-learn for its core functionality.
# Backend Service
The Backend Service acts as the central hub for data processing and management. It handles requests from the frontend, processes data through the AI Model Service, and returns the results to the user. This service is designed to be scalable and efficient, capable of handling large volumes of data and requests.
# Dashboard
The Dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with CyberShield's services. It allows users to monitor their cybersecurity status, view threat reports, and access educational resources on cybersecurity best practices. The dashboard is built using React, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience.
# Database
The Database component is responsible for storing and managing all data related to CyberShield's operations. It ensures that data is securely stored and can be efficiently accessed by the other services. This component is built using PostgreSQL, a powerful and reliable database system.
